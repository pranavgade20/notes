		\section{Evolution of computers}
			Computers started as very large machines, taking up massive amounts of energy. They used terminals as input, and printers as output.
			
			Scientists used computers for simulations, solving, and regression analysis. Until 1993, non-structured languages like COBOL, Pascal, etc. were available. Around 1993, structured languages like C appeared. And around 1998, Object Oriented languages started appearing. These focused on layered/tiered approach. Around the same time, layered approach to server design became popular.

				\hline
				Non-Structured Languages & Structured Languages \\
				\hline
				Allowed goto/jump statements, so you could jump to any line of code. & Excecution proceeds sequentially \\
				\hline
				This made stuff very convoluted & This makes the program easier to follow \\
				\hline
			\end{tabular}

			Layered approach in server design(fig. \ref{fig:request-response-model}) provides encapsulation. This allows a more granular control over security and permission management. It also helps to mitigate downtimes and service issues. Along with this, multiple services can interact with, say, the same database server, thus reducing redundancy.

		\section{Software requirements}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Functional Requirements:} This describes how the software must function/operate.
				\item \textbf{Non-Functional Requirements:} These are factors like performance, load, number of users, etc.
